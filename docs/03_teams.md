# Teams

This section more clearly defines the UAV Project teams and overall internal structure of the UAV Project. We have been divided into 3 teams by the Club President. Be mindful of the Project organization and goals at all times. In order to effectively manage this project we need to be in sync and informed properly. Know who to talk to about what and when to not overload any AEC member. We all have to manage our school and even work duties. Please stay in touch with your team leader regularly and only go to the Club President for this project if needed.
